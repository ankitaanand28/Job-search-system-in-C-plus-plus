<h4>
This Project is made with makefile for easy working and user friendly instructions are provided.
In this project , I have used various data structures like vectors, map and sets .</h4>
<br>
<h4> In this job searching system , user is asked to create his/her account and their data are password protected so that they can only retrive it.
 I have created a program which will match user specifications  for elligibility in various job opening available to the system.
 I have put personalised requirements for each job opening provided, for making it more realistic.
 <br>
 The system  provide the user with options that suits their profile, and then the user can apply in any of them.
 If the qualifications of user matches with the job requirements perfectly , he/she gets chosen for the job.
